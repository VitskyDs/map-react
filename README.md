# FEND-Project8 Neighborhood Map

This is a map of my favorite places in Jerusalem. You can click on either location to see its properties and filter locations by categories (Secular, Religious, Hangout).

This project uses the Google Maps API for the map and markers and the Foursquare API for info about the different locations.
